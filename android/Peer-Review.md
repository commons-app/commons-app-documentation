Change request #3361



For peer review information:

A user will log into the app, select settings then select Review.

If it is the user's first time logging into the app, the user will receive a general pop up that informs them of the process.


The user will have three options on screen.


No, Out of Scope - This selection should only be used if the image itself is not relevant to it's categories and deemed useless. The user then can nominate the image for deletion.


Yes, Seems Fine. - This will approve a recommendation for the image, the user will then also approve if it follows copyright laws, then the user can eventually thank the contributor.


Skip Image. Skipping an image will generate a new random recently uploaded image that hasn't been verified. 



If the user needs more information about what each selection does. There is a tooltip on the top right of the page that leads into a help section.

The user then can select one of the three options on the view: No,Out of Scope. Yes, Seems Fine. Skip Image. which will then take them to an infobox that provides high level detail for each of the selections.
