# Frequently Asked Questions

**What is this app about?**

> "Wikimedia Commons" (short form "Commons") is a media repository that is created and maintained by volunteers. It provides a central repository for freely licensed photographs, diagrams, animations, music, spoken text, video clips, and media of all sorts that are useful for any Wikimedia project, the most well-known of which is Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The name "Wikimedia Commons" is derived from the umbrella project Wikimedia that manages all Wikimedia projects and the word "common" as it is a common project (commons) that stores media for use on all Wikimedia projects.

**What is the scope of this project?**

> See Commons:Project scope. The page Commons:What Commons is not may also be of interest.

**Can I put material on this app?**

> Yes, you definitely can! In fact, that's what we want you to do. Just start with the First steps in order to join the project.


**What materials can I upload?**

> Any freely licensed media file (images, sound, video, etc.) that is useful for any Wikimedia project can be uploaded. For acceptable file types, see Commons:File types. The licenses must allow for commercial use and the creation of derivative works.1 See also the copyright question for the required license conditions. If you are interested in uploading images, you may find it helpful to read Commons:Image casebook.

**Can I upload text of which I am the author?**

> Commons is about multimedia content (images, video, sound), not text. Text may, depending on form and content, fit into some other Wikimedia project, such as Wikibooks, Wikipedia, Wikisource, or Wikiversity. However, please note that you must not copy and paste text to these other projects unless you are willing to release it into the public domain or license it for use under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike (CC BY or CC BY-SA) licenses. For example, to use text from a website—even your own—that external website must exhibit a clear statement of such public domain release or CC BY-SA licensing.
