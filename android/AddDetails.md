This is to change request #3971


A feature request was added to the upload image process.


When the user uploads an image they now have the option to click a checkbox that adds detail later.

This is in step 1 of 5, where the user is entering in their caption and description.

Right below the description text box the user can select the option "Add details later"

This will append a string to the end of the description that informs the reviewer that there will be more information to update the image later.
